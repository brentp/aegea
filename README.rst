Aegea: Amazon Web Services Operator Interface
=============================================

*Aegea* is a command line interface (CLI) that provides a set of essential commands and terminal dashboards for
operators of Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the existing
functionality of the `AWS CLI <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`_.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run ``pip install .`` in this directory to install Aegea. Before you do this, you will also need to install some system
library dependencies:

+--------------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| OS X         |         | `Install Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_. Run                                              |
|              |         | ``brew install openssl moreutils && brew link --force openssl``.                        |
+--------------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Run ``aws configure`` to configure `IAM <https://aws.amazon.com/iam/>`_ access credentials that will be used by the
``aws`` and ``aegea`` commands. You can create a new IAM key at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users.

Configuration management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aegea supports ingesting configuration from a configurable array of sources. Each source is a JSON or YAML file.
Configuration sources that follow the first source update the configuration using recursive dictionary merging. Sources are
enumerated in the following order (i.e., in order of increasing priority):

- Site-wide configuration source, ``/etc/NAME/config.(yml|json)``
- User configuration source, ``~/.config/NAME/config.(yml|json)``
- Any sources listed in the colon-delimited variable ``NAME_CONFIG_FILE``
- Command line options

**Array merge operators**: When loading a chain of configuration sources, Aegea uses recursive dictionary merging to
combine the sources. Additionally, when the original config value is a list, Aegea supports array manipulation
operators, which let you extend and modify arrays defined in underlying configurations. See
https://github.com/kislyuk/tweak#array-merge-operators for a list of these operators.

Aegea Batch
~~~~~~~~~~~
The `AWS Batch <https://aws.amazon.com/batch>`_ API currently requires you to use the us-east-1 region. You can use
``aws configure`` to select this region.

`aegea/missions/docker-example/ <aegea/missions/docker-example/>`_ is a root directory of an **aegea mission** -
a configuration management role. It has a rootfs.skel and a config.yml, which has directives to install packages,
etc. The example just installs the bwa APT package.

Run ``aegea-build-image-for-mission docker-example dex`` to build an ECR image called dex from the "docker-example"
mission. You can list ECR images with ``aegea ecr ls``.

Run ``aegea batch submit --ecs-image dex --command "bwa aln || true" "bwa mem || true" --memory 2048 --vcpus 4 --watch``
to run a Batch job that requires 2 GB RAM and 4 cores to be allocated to the Docker container, using the "dex" image,
and executes two commands as listed after --command, using "bash -euo pipefail -c".

You can also use ``aegea batch submit --execute FILE``. This will slurp up FILE (any type of shell script or ELF
executable) and execute it in the job's Docker container.

The concurrency and cost of your Batch jobs is governed by the "Max vCPUs" setting in your compute environment. To
To change the capacity or other settings of your compute environment, go to
https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/home?region=us-east-1#/compute-environments, select "aegea_batch", and click "Edit".

AWS Batch launches and manages `ECS <https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/>`_ host instances to execute your jobs. You can see the
host instances by running ``aegea ls``.
